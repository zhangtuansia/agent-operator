## Features

### Simplified OAuth Authentication
- Craft Agent now exclusively uses its own OAuth flow for authentication
- Removed Claude CLI/Desktop token detection and import functionality
- Users with legacy tokens will be prompted to re-authenticate once
- Cleaner, more reliable authentication experience

### Developer Testing Tools
- New `test-token-refresh.ts` script for OAuth token testing and debugging
- Supports login, expiry simulation, origin detection, and migration testing
- Added `--token-only` flag to fresh-start script for testing onboarding without losing workspace data

## Improvements

### OAuth Token Logging
- Token refresh operations now log expiry timestamps for easier debugging
- Better visibility into token lifecycle and refresh behavior

### Icon Cache Robustness
- Fixed null handling for missing workspace icons
- IPC calls now properly return null instead of throwing for missing images
- Added comprehensive tests for icon cache edge cases

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed auto-activation failing for sources with `authType: none` (e.g., Context7) ([#72](https://github.com/lukilabs/craft-agents-oss/issues/72))
- `source_test` now correctly sets `isAuthenticated` for MCP, API, and local sources that don't require authentication
- Fixed session date grouping changing after app restart by persisting `lastMessageAt` separately ([#69](https://github.com/lukilabs/craft-agents-oss/issues/69))
- Fixed empty placeholder docs by copying documentation assets into Electron dist ([#70](https://github.com/lukilabs/craft-agents-oss/issues/70))
- Fixed OSS `electron:dist:mac` builds by adding missing scripts to allow-list ([#71](https://github.com/lukilabs/craft-agents-oss/issues/71))
- Fixed potential crash when workspace icon file doesn't exist
- Fixed IPC error handling for missing workspace images
