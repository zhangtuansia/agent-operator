# v0.3.1 — Session Search & Mini Agents

Search across all your sessions instantly. Mini agents for quick, focused edits.

---

## ✨ Session Search

Find anything across your conversation history with full-text search powered by ripgrep.

### How It Works

**Quick Access**
Press `Cmd/Ctrl + F` or click the search icon in the sidebar to start searching.

**Smart Results**
- Searches user and assistant messages only (filters out system noise)
- Shows match snippets directly in the session list
- Highlights matches in real-time as you type

**Navigation**
- Use chevron buttons to jump between matches
- Auto-scrolls to the matching text in the conversation
- Match counter shows total occurrences across all sessions
- Auto-expands paginated turns to reveal earlier matches

**Performance**
- Ripgrep-based search for instant results even with thousands of sessions
- Only highlights visible matches to keep scrolling smooth

## ✨ Mini Agents

Lightweight agents for quick configuration edits without the full Claude Code overhead.

### What's New

**Focused Editing**
Mini agents use a lean system prompt optimized for specific tasks like editing statuses and labels. No unnecessary tools or context.

**Faster & Cheaper**
Configurable to use faster models (like Haiku) for simple tasks that don't need full reasoning power.

**Inline Execution UI**
New compact progress display shows what the agent is doing right inside popovers:
- Last 3 activities with descriptions
- File paths and patterns being processed
- Success/error messages rendered as markdown

**Draggable Popovers**
Edit popovers now have a grip handle — drag them anywhere on screen.
