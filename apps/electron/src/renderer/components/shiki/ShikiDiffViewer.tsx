/**
 * ShikiDiffViewer - Electron wrapper for the portable ShikiDiffViewer
 *
 * This thin wrapper imports the portable component from @agent-operator/ui
 * and connects it to Electron's ThemeContext.
 *
 * Note: The base component uses a simpler timing approach for onReady.
 * If more precise timing is needed for window reveal, the onReady callback
 * fires after a short delay (100ms) to allow Shiki to highlight.
 *
 * The diff viewer uses pierre-dark/pierre-light themes which are optimized
 * for diff visualization rather than the preset Shiki themes.
