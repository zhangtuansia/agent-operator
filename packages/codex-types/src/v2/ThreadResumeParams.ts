 * There are three ways to resume a thread:
 * 1. By thread_id: load the thread from disk by thread_id and resume it.
 * 2. By history: instantiate the thread from memory and resume it.
 * 3. By path: load the thread from disk by path and resume it.
 *
 * The precedence is: history > path > thread_id.
 * If using history or path, the thread_id param will be ignored.
 *
 * Prefer using thread_id whenever possible.
